nomad (sic) is a responsive web-based game allowing users to explore the world through guessing the exact location of crowdsourced photos. Users are able to upload images, from which coordinates are parsed, and these images become part of a game that users can play globally. It's clean design includes a 3D globe on which color-coded arcs represent the difference between the user's guess and the correct location. nomad (sic) supports multiplayer mode, and creating a network of friends on the app.
